<h1 align="center"> Learn Math for Data Science </h1>

Why should we care about Math and consider learning something that is often deemed as boring? To answer that, I will use a quote by Galileu Galilei: "in order to understand the universe, we must first understand the language it is written in â€“ that language is mathematics. And the characters are the geometry shapes like triangles, squares, cubes and many others". 

Math is present everywhere in our lives. That's why it is important.

## About this Repository

<p align="center"> <img src="https://keystoneacademic-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_fill,w_1920/element/11/112515_photo-1545841729-10c1118027a1.jpg" alt="Math" width="50%" height="10%"/> </a> </p>

The main goal of this repository is to cover the fundamentals topics of Mathematics, starting from the basics like arithmetic, basic algebra, square roots, and progressing to advanced topics such as linear algebra and calculus.

Note: The focus of this project is Math, but I will use Python for demonstrate some of the concepts.

Note 2: This repo is under development and will likely be updated continuosly.
